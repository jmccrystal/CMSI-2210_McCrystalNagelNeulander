SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

Nice work here, looks like everything is working for you.

Excellent that you attempted the assembly code right out of the gate!  I'm
assuming that it is for a mac with ARM-type processor since your code uses
the "X" registers.  Nice!

One thing to remember about ARM code is, not all processors that are ARMs
will have the same register structure, due to the different implementations
that ARM manufacturers use.  Also, there are quite likely some command line
'switches' [which start with a 'dash' character] that you'll need to type on
the line when you assemble and link.  Finally, with assembly code it is a
good idea to be helpful to your team mates and others by including a small
header in the source file that states the assembly and linking instructions
so that others know what to do to make your program.

As a challenge to yourselves, see if you can find a different way of reading
   values from the user.  There are several different ways of doing that, so
   do a little research to see what else is available.

Off to a great start!

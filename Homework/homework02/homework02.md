1. What is a computer system?

A computer system is a collection of interconnected components organized in layers that work together to process, store, and communicate information. 

2. What are some of the parts of a computer system?

The main components are the CPU, memory, input devices (keyboard, mouse, microphone), output devices (monitor, printer, speakers), storage devices (hard drives, SSDs), and the motherboard that connects everything. Also included is the software that runs on the computer.

3. What is the difference between a compiled language and an interpreted language?

Compiled languages convert source code into machine code before running, while interpreted languages translate and execute code line by line during runtime. Compiled programs normally run faster but have a compilation step first.

4. Is C a compiled language?

Yes, C is compiled. The source code gets converted to machine code before running.

5. Who invented the C language?

Dennis Ritchie invented the C language. [Source](https://www.britannica.com/technology/C-computer-programming-language)

6. How long has C been in use?

C has been around since the early 1970s, so it's been in use for over 50 years. [Source](https://www.britannica.com/technology/C-computer-programming-language)

7. Is a compiler a translator?

Yes, a compiler translates high-level source code into assembly or machine language.

8. Is an assembler a translator?

Yes, an assembler translates assembly language instructions into machine language binary code.

9. What is the command to list out the contents of a directory on a Mac terminal window?
ls

10. What does the C function atof() do?
The atof() function converts a number from a string into a double value. It stands for "ASCII to float". [Source](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/atof/)

11. What are the bottom two layers of a computer system? Give a brief description of each.

The bottom two layers are the Digital Logic Layer, which is comprised of raw electronics like bare circuits and logic gates, and the Control Layer, which is made of hardwired circuits and microcode.

12. What are the three steps of the Von Neumann Architecture?

First, the control unit fetches the next instruction from memory (tracked by the program counter register). Second, the instruction is decoded so the processor knows what to do, fetching additional data if needed. Third, the ALU executes the instruction, storing results in registers or memory

13. What is the purpose of an ALU?

The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations on data. It processes inputs from CPU registers, RAM, ROM, or internal constants.

14. What is a register?

A register is temporary storage inside the CPU that holds data or addresses during processing. The program counter, for example, is a register that tracks instruction locations.

15. What is one difference between Application software and System software?

Application software is designed for users and handles concepts like customers and products, while system software is designed for the computer itself and abstracts away technical concepts like registers and memory addresses.

16. Is the phrase cmp rdi, rsi machine language?

No, it is assembly language. Assembly can be directly translated to binary machine language, but assembly cannot be directly read by the CPU.

17. How many buses are included in the system bus?

Three buses: the data bus (transfers data), the address bus (carries memory addresses), and the control bus (coordinates system operations).

18. What is the decimal value of 11111111? (binary)

255 (128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1)

19. What is the decimal value of 10010111? (binary)

151 (128 + 16 + 4 + 2 + 1)

20. What is the largest unsigned integer value that will fit into 16 bits?

65,535 (2^16 - 1)
